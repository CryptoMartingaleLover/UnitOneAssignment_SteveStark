[5:50 PM] # HOMEWORK #1 - CASE STUDY
## IOHK
## Overview and Origin
* Name of company
    * IOHK - Input Output Hong Kong
* When was the company incorporated?
    * 2015
* Who are the founders of the company?
    * Charles Hoskinson & Jeremy Wood
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    * The company's 'About' pg states that their founding principle is to force a transformation of the world's current financial, governmental and social systems into something more fair and transparent in terms of value and the flow of ideas. Their greatest endeavor on this path - and primary reason for being - has been their role in the development of the Cardano blockchain platform. 
    * As original Cardano author and IOHK CEO/Founder Charles Hoskinson explains in the video "IOHK | Cardano whiteboard; overview with Charles Hoskinson" (https://youtu.be/Ja9D0kpksxw), the idea of the Cardano project came about as an evolution of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. To summarize Hoskinson:
        * 1st Gen - the first generation was Bitcoin. The limitation of this generation, as Hoskinson explains, was that "the transaction... has more than just the act of moving money associated with it. There's a story behind that transaction. There's terms and conditions." In other words, the parties of a transaction are also parties to the agreements which led to that transaction, i.e. contracts. 
            * 1st Gen technology was not suited to accommodate this. Bitcoin was not designed to be customizable. "Every single time someone wanted to make a change to Bitcoin, they'd have to build another cryptocurrency," says Hoskinson, "or they'd have to figure out how to install some cumbersome overylay protocol." 
            * This led Hoskinson and his partners to develop the first 2nd Gen blockchain.
        * 2nd Gen - Ethereum was the first to bring a programming language to a blockchain, allowing smart contracts to be employed to customize transactions. Now, transactions are encoded with their defining terms and conditions. 
            * As with 1st Gen, 2nd Gen reached a point of technological limitation. 
                * Ethereum cannot scale to billions of users. Governance and sustainability are also issues Hoskinson identifies for many 2nd Gen cryptocurrencies.
        * 3rd Gen - is all about 3 topics
            * These are the matters which Cardano seeks to optimize, according to Charles Hoskinson:
                1. Scalability
                2. Interoperability
                3. Sustainability
            * IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson says, "The Cardano project is really our philosophy, our vision on how to solve each of these categories in a way that we feel is going to inherit the best features and lessons learned from generation 1 and generation 2, but also add a lot of new concepts and technology to the space."
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    * IOHK is a private company, and from available public information appears to be privately funded. Cardano was initially funded via an ICO - Initial Coin Offering. Original market cap was $600 million, and at the time of writing is the 5th highest cryptocurrency market cap of  $50.26 billion.
## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    * How to develop a blockchain that is customizable, interoperable with others, sustainably-funded and scalable to accommodate global use. 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    * At present, the intended customers are especially the people of the unbanked third world countries of Africa. In specific, special use cases have been formally rolled out to engage 5 million regular new users in Ethiopia. 
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * There are many. Scalability is one which has already been mentioned. Interoperability will be sgnificantly upgraded in the very near term by the Alonzo hard fork and Plutus smart contract update, which will be discussed in a detailed announcement on "Cardano 360" on Thursday, May 27, 2021. And the Hydra update is coming soon, which will allow Cardano to process as many as 2 million transactions per second. For context, Ethereum is capable of processing 30 transactions per second, and even with anticipated updates is only expected to reach up to 200,000 transactions per second.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    * Haskell programming language
    * Blockchain
    * Smart Contracts
## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    * Blockchain/Cryptocurrency
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    * Rapidly expanding growth and popularity
    * A volatile bull-bear cycle
    * The development of thousands of crypto coins and many variants of ways to make money trading them
    * Expansion of use cases
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    * Many, but the largest by measure of market capitalization at the time of writing are:
        1. Bitcoin
        2. Ethereum
        3. Tether
        4. Binance Coin
        5. Cardano
## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * Through their development of Cardano, IOHK are pushing innovation in the industry. 
    * PRISM - a recently-launched program in concert with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education, using the Cardano blockchain to issue IDs and track student performance for 5 million students. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    * Coin Value - was at about $0.183 on January 1, 2021 and is currently at $1.61.
    * Market Capitalization - currently ranked 5th out of all cryptocurrencies.
    * Volume - trading at over $5.6 billion per day
    * Collaborative Partnerships/Projects - many, and more on the way
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Strongly.  
## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    * Being a full-time real estate agent, my mind keeps returning to the common residential real estate transaction. I think blockchain - and specifically Cardano - holds a lot of implications for real estate. I would like to see a one-stop shop on the Cardano platorm for transferring ownership of real property in exchange for crypto.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * Income. Just in my county of approximately 602,000 residents, there was nearly $4.6 billion in residential real estate sales in 2020.  
    * Societal improvement - making real estate transactions simpler, more efficient and less expensive would open up a lot of opportunity for people, and would align with the IOHK mission statement.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * Blockchain - appropriate because it would allow for tracking of transactions, document authentication, personal identification
    * Smart contracts - to establish and enforce the rules within the transaction
    * Internet browsers & websites - GUI for the public user
    * Cryptocurrency - for the exchange of value
    * Crypto wallets - for interparty transfer of funds
    * Possibly smart home technologies - I'm not sure... maybe one day buying a home would be like buying a Coke from a vending machine, and when the transaction is over the smart home is updated with your biometric details and the lights are on and door is opened for you when you arrive for the first time.
